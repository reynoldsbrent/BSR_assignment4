        PHP was first created as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries that were written in C. 
        It was originally used for tracking the visits to his personal webpage resume. PHP stood for “Personal Home Page Tools.” 
        It was rewrote by Rasmus to allow developers to interact with databases and create dynamic web applications. 
        The versions of PHP include PHP Tools, PHP/FI 2.0,  PHP 3, PHP 4, and PHP 5.
        PHP is a general-purpose server side and scripting language which is typically used for building dynamic web applications and websites.
        According to the official site for PHP, it is presumed that PHP is installed on “tens or even hundreds of millions of domains around the world.” (PHP)
